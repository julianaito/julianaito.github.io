>charlenew.xyz shut down</a></h2>

<p>Given the very low traffic,
i don&#39;t care much,
but i think it&#39;s a polite thing to do,
especially that a few people are following my atom feed.</p>

<p>I need to reduce my computer usage,
and that also means maintaining less machines.</p>

<p>While i enjoyed setting this site up,
i never had a big use of that machine actually.
I&#39;ve saved the site content to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211018095309/https://charlenew.xyz/" class="podlinkurl"
>archive.org</a>,
and i&#39;m currently moving things to <a href="https://julianaito.github.io" class="podlinkurl"
>github.com</a>.</p>

<p>You can expect the site to be shut down starting October 19 14:00 UTC with a redirection pointing to github,
if it plays well with HSTS that i&#39;ve removed,
i&#39;m pretty sure it won&#39;t :P</p>

<p>I won&#39;t renew the domain so it&#39;s going down around June 2022 in any case.</p>
