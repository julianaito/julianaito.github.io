<p>Given the very low traffic,
i don&#39;t care much,
but i think it&#39;s a polite thing to do,
especially that a few people are following my atom feed.</p>

<p>I need to reduce my computer usage,
and that also means maintaining less machines.</p>

<p>While i enjoyed setting this site up,
i never had a big use of that machine actually.
I&#39;ve saved the site content to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211018095309/https://charlenew.xyz/" class="podlinkurl"
>archive.org</a>,
and i&#39;m currently moving things to <a href="https://julianaito.github.io" class="podlinkurl"
>github.com</a>.</p>
<span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">

You can expect charlenew.xyz to be shut down starting October 19 14:00 UTC with a
redirection pointing to github</span>. If it plays well with HSTS that i've removed,
i'm pretty sure it won't :P

</p>


<p>I won&#39;t renew the domain so it&#39;s going down around June 2022 in any case.</p>

>Loading a mpv profile according to the CPU model on OpenBSD</a></a></h4>

<p>I recently found out that mpv was stuttering when i used it on my old Intel Pineview Atom box because the normalisation audio filter munched all the CPU time.
I wondered if i could load a profile according to the CPU used,
and finally managed to do it.</p>

>Create a custom FreeDOS USB live media on OpenBSD</a></a></h4>

<p>While modern BIOSes are actually tiny operating systems that can update themself through the net,
i still have a number of old machines that requires either Windows or a MS-DOS &#39;floppy&#39; to update their bios.</p>

>How i&#39;ve moved my git repos branches from <i>master</i> to <i>main</i></a></a></h4>

<p>There are tutorials everywhere explaining how to do so.
But in my case,
it&#39;s a bit special: i use my own git frontend,
and have to deal with remote bare repos.</p>

<h4><a class='u'
name="Cross_compiling_ports_with_distcc_on_OpenBSD"
><a href="/pages/distcc.html" class="podlinkpod"
>Cross compiling ports with distcc on OpenBSD</a></a></h4>

<p>One thing is sure; compiling software on OpenBSD/macppc requires a lot of patience,
even with several machines and distcc.
I can&#39;t add machines indefinitely ...
but since the move to clang,
it&#39;s now possible to use an amd64 machine as a macppc distcc helper,
and i&#39;m going to detail how i did it.</p>
